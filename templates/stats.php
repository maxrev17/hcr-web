          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p style="height:120px;">CHARLES aims to interact with the general public in order to bring them to this site. CHARLES hands out tickets which have a 
              link to the icrobot.net printed on them. Using a unique URL for each person CHARLES talks with, we will be able to see how successful he
              is at encouraging people to follow the link on the ticket.</p>

          <h2>Testing Theories</h2>
          <p style="height:120px;">CHARLES has several modes of interaction, ranging from standing still and printing tickets, right up to talking with people and 
          encouraging them to take a ticket via conversation. The data collected from these interactions will be linked with the unique URL, so we can test which 
          mode of interaction is most successful.</p>

          <h2>Communication</h2>
          <p style="height:120px;">In order to display emotion, CHARLES has a face which is able to display a variety of expressions. This is combined with an ability to 
          speak using text-to-speech software. Together these systems allow CHARLES to conduct a 'human-like' interaction with members of the public.</p>
