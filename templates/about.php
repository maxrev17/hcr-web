The Project (What?)
CHARLES (Centralised Human Action Robot Leaflet Effect System) is designed to look at the long term effect of interaction.  

In short, if you find our robot more interesting and engaging, more people will take a leaflet, and some of those might be interested enough to follow the link to this website.

Our robot uses a Kinect (for detecting people), a Raspberry Pi talking to printer (for the receipts), an ActivMedia PeopleBot and a couple of laptops to tie it all together.

The Team (Who?)
We’re a group of fourth year students studying Electronic & Information Engineering, as part of the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department at Imperial College London.

This project is part of the course: “Human-Centered Robotics.” In part, it looks to study the interaction between robots and humans, collaboration and how the experience can be improved in the future.

What Now?
You can find out even more information about the robot from our FACEBOOK group.  The robot will keep you posted as to what its getting up to, its adventures and the results of our experiment.

We’ll also post links to our design report and final report if you want to find out the nitty gritty details behind CHARLES.
